## Redix Router

Redis-based switch and stream processing framework to route messages between Redix processors, and Redis queues e.g. for reactive microservices.


## Overview

Messages might be imported and exported, and otherwise routed between processors.

Metadata is attached to messages e.g. for routing and processing purposes.

The first use-case we need is a reliable queue for multiple consumers, implemented as follows:
- pop incoming messages from a Redis producer queue
- push each incoming message onto multiple consumer queues
- consumer microservices then pop messages off their consumer queues

The above enables reliable messaging for multiple reactive consumers. If a consumer is busy, or crashed, its messages are delivered when it is available again, via its blocking pop operation on its Redis queue.

Also note that multiple workers can operate off a single consumer queue for scalability and resilience.


## Processors

A "processor" is a component that processes messages.

Processors might be classified as follows:
- importer - import a message from a external source.
- exporter - export a message to an external source.
- router - dispatch a message (internally).
- enqueuer - dispatch a message into a Redis queue.
- dequeuer - pop a message from a Redis queue, and dispatch this message.
- compacter - eliminate messages from a queue.

We will implement a number of generally useful built-in processors, but the idea is that custom and third-party processors can be used in your deployment.


## Configuration

Each processor is configured via a YAML file in the Redix `configDir.`

The naming convention of the processor is a colon notation e.g. `builtin:FileImporter:default.`

This is its Node module, JavaScript class, and finally its distinguishing instance name.

The "module" enables custom and third-party processors e.g. a `myredix:FancyProcessor` where `myredix` is an `npm` module which exports a `FancyProcessor` class.

The distinguishing name enables multiple instances of the same processor class, configured for different purposes.

Note that `npm` enables version dependency via `package.json.` Also, multiple versions of the same module can be installed as differently named modules, e.g. `myredix-2.0.0:FancyProcessor.`


## Messages

The following is envisaged for messages, but is yet to be implemented.

The interface of different message types can be defined, and for multiple versions. We define the mandatory and optional properties, and their types e.g. string, int, boolean. This is useful for assertions during testing, and automated error handling.

Processors should specify the message versions they can handle, and otherwise reject messages.

Transformative processors can be used to coerce messages into the expected format or required version.

However, we expect multiple versions of processors will be installed to support older messages, for some period.


## Concurrency

We use message queues to avoid concurrent operations.

Both Redis and Node have single-threaded event loops, which simplifies concurrency.

We use Redis for queues and "shared memory" accessed by Node processors.

Our processors are message-passing "actors," and otherwise must use Redis transactions.


## Examples

### FileImporter

Import a message from a directory.

Config: `FileImporter.default.yaml`
```yaml
watchDir: tmp/fileImporter/import/
replyDir: tmp/fileImporter/export/
route:
- HttpClient.default
```

Incoming message: `fileImporter/import/1.yaml`
```yaml
method: GET
url: http://data.iol.io/s/frontage
```

Reply: `fileImporter/export/1.json`
```json
{
  "id": 1862764,
  "link": "http://www.iol.co.za/sport/soccer/platini-won-t-vote-for-blatter",
  "published": "2015-05-25T09:03:19.000Z",
  "title": "Platini wonâ€™t vote for Blatter",
}
```

### HttpClient exporter

Export a message via an HTTP request.

Config: `HttpClient.default.yaml`
```yaml
message:
- method # e.g. GET, POST
- url
```

Incoming message: `tmp/fileImporter/import/1.yaml`
```yaml
method: GET
url: http://data.iol.io/s/frontage
```

### RedisHttpRequestImporter

Import an HTTP request message from an "external" Redis queue.

Config: `RedisHttpRequestImporter.default.yaml`
```yaml
queue: test:http # the redis key for the queue (list)
message:
- method # e.g. GET, POST
- url
```
